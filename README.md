# supervised-machine-learning-challenge
# Use the lending_data provided to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans
# Predict which model; Logistic Regression or Random Forests Classifier will work better on the provided dataset
# Compared the Logistic Regression and Random Forests Classifier models
# Observed which model did a better job classifying and conclude based on initial prediction
